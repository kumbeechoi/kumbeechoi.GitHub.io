                    <h3>My History and Thoughts</h3> 
                    <section>
                        
                        <p>
                        <br>
                        After graduating with Bachelor's degree in graphic design, I have worked as a motion graphics designer for different clients, ranging from small agencies to big corporations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I enjoyed working as a designer, but then I started thinking about expanding my comfort zone to computers and coding because I wanted more freedom. It is great to create contents people enjoy, but it is much more important to create platforms where people can upload those in the first place so then people can connect more easily especially because more and more people started to go online when the pandemic started.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I chose Thinkful, because... </p>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Its prep course took me step-by-step. </li>
                            <li>it has a great community of like-minded students and programmers communicating through Slack.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I hope that I can collaborate with students and future coworkers to work on new and exciting projects.
                        </p>
